                You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blow, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

                When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or Long Rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.
